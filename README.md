# 😷 Face Mask Detection Using OpenCV and Machine Learning

A simple and effective Face Mask Detection system built using **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**. The project detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a webcam feed or input images.

---

## 📌 Features

- Detects faces in real-time using Haar Cascades
- Classifies faces with or without masks using a CNN model
- Built using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras
- Trained on a custom dataset with augmentation

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Preprocess and augment dataset (with/without mask).
2. Train a CNN model on the images.
3. Use OpenCV Haar cascade to detect faces.
4. Predict mask status using trained CNN.
